# GHWE – Guitar Hero Web Engine  
A custom-made **Guitar Hero-style rhythm engine** for the web. Just drop in your own MP3s, and it converts them **in real time** into playable charts!  

Currently in **beta** – beat detection accuracy is around **80%**, depending on the songs beats. It’s already fun, but still evolving!

---

**Note:**  
For now, the game includes a selection of **preloaded songs**.  
I’m working on adding **drag-and-drop support**, so you’ll be able to load and play your **own tracks**!

## How to Play

1. **Download the Project**  
   Clone or download this repository and run it locally.

2. **Add Your Songs**  
   Drop your `.mp3` files into the `Songs/` directory to play your own music.  
   _Drag-and-drop support is in development!_

3. **Launch the Game**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser—**Opera GX** is recommended for best timing accuracy.

4. **Start Playing**  
   Choose a song and tap the falling notes in rhythm.  
   Perfect timing = higher score!

**No download? No problem (for now):**  
The game includes a few **preloaded songs** for demo purposes.  
⚠️ _These will be removed in the future to avoid potential copyright issues._

## ⚠️ Known Issues
**For now, use _Opera GX_ on desktop and mobile.**  
Chrome has a beat delay issue that I’m actively working on.
