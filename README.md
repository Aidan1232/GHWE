# 🎸 GHWE – Guitar Hero Web Engine  
A custom-made **Guitar Hero-style rhythm engine** for the web. Just drop in your own MP3s, and it converts them **in real time** into playable charts!  

Currently in **beta** – beat detection accuracy is around **80%**, depending on the songs beats. It’s already fun, but still evolving!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Download the Project**  
   Clone or download this repository from GitHub. You'll be running the game locally for now.

2. **Add Your Songs**  
   Inside the project folder, go to the `songs/` directory and add your `.mp3` files there manually.  
   📝 _Drag-and-drop support isn't available yet—stay tuned!_

3. **Start the Game**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser (preferably **Opera GX**). This will load the game with your preloaded songs.

4. **Play and Tap!**  
   Select a track from the menu and tap the falling notes as they hit the judgment line.  
   Timing matters—nail those Perfects!

## ⚠️ Known Issues
**For now, use _Opera GX_ on desktop and mobile.**  
Chrome has a beat delay issue that I’m actively working on.
