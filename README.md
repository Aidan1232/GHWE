# 🎸 GHWE – Guitar Hero Web Engine  
A custom-made **Guitar Hero-style rhythm engine** for the web. Just drop in your own MP3s, and it converts them **in real time** into playable charts!  

Currently in **beta** – beat detection accuracy is around **80%**, depending on the songs beats. It’s already fun, but still evolving!

## ⚠️ Known Issues
**For now, use _Opera GX_ on desktop and mobile.**  
Chrome has a beat delay issue that I’m actively working on.
